**This document presents a comprehensive collection of commonly used models and datasets in the field of zero-shot image classification. The "TZSL&GZSL Models" folder contains open-source models for traditional/generalized zero-shot image classification, while the "TZSL&GZSL Datasets" folder includes commonly used datasets for these approaches. The "CZSL Models" folder holds open-source models for compositional zero-shot image classification, with frequently used datasets for this task stored in the "CZSL Datasets" folder. Additionally, links to relevant papers are provided in the readme.md files.**
